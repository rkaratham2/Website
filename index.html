    <p><a href="">Big data</a> primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Though used sometimes loosely partly because of a lack of formal definition, the interpretation that seems to best describe big data is the one associated with large body of information that we could not comprehend when used only in smaller amounts.</p>
     <strong>Big Data analysis</strong> challenges include  capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source.

    h2>definition</h2>
    <p>The term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term.[22][23] Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.</p>
